# Responsive grid in resizeable panel

Responsive components generally rely on media queries to adjust to screen size. But what if the screen size stays the same and you're simply resizing a component within the screen?

This demo shows creating a resizeable 4 column panel which is ideal for using as a property panel for applications. The 4 columns become responsive when some code applies the correct styling based on the width of the panel.
